# MyWonder_App
Mobile friendly application to run big data analytic and visualization

Project Summary:

MyWonder will help user to perform big data analysis and create visualization from massive files in 10 min instead of hours using integrated cloud storage system. At the moment, users or data scientists in need of data analysis may keep their data inside their own local machine and this may impose danger of outdated version of data. Since it usually take hours to run the data analysis, or re-run it again if data were outdated, may result in users have to make a lot of preparation in their workspace long time before joining a meeting.

MyWonder will use state of the art techniques to run big data analytic and visualization efficiently. Since data were stored in cloud storage, in addition to efficiency for user to update or access files, the system surely will always compute based on the latest updated data. MyWonder can be accessed from phone to do calculations and summaries, where the result can also be stored in the system so that different user with same queries can just get result of previous user's queries, given there was no change in data. This way, we believe MyWonder will increase efficiency in data calculation and visualization.
